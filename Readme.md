This is an exploratory analysis on Crime of LA (2010-2017) focus on visualization with the use of plotly, leaflet, worldcloud and ggplot.
Exploratory analysis can be a very good practice in the sense of digging down the information of the data and trying to find something useful in it.
In this analysis, I use plotly, worldcloud and ggplot to summarize a lot of information from the data, including why the data behave like this, what is the possible cause, is there any human manipulation of the data, what will it cause.

However, the most useful stuff I guess is the map I generated using leaflet, they point out some dangerous places in LA (like heated points for rape, children crimes etc.) while the color of the icon stands for the level of danger.

The language is R, but ggplot,plotly and leaflet they are also available in other languages like python with some minor difference.
